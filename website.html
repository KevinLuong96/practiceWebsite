      <h2>What is a cat?</h2>
      <p>A cat, or Felis felice, is a warm blooded, domesticated mammal which
      is common throughtout households due to their appearance, affection and 
      love. Cats are mostly carnivorous and have a remarkable innate hunting 
      ability. They are able to catch and eat small rodents and even birds 
      despite some cats living their entire lives within captivity. 
      Cats enjoy warmth, sitting in small boxes(lol) and often sit in a shape 
      colloquially known as a 
      <a src="http://www.voguesugar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Catloaf-18.jpg">"catloaf"</a> 
      where they tuck their arms and legs under their body to form the 
      distinctively unusual shape.</p>

<!--         A tabby is any domestic cat that has a coat featuring distinctive 
        stripes, dots, lines or swirling patterns, usually together with a mark 
        resembling an 'M' on its forehead. Tabbies are sometimes erroneously 
        assumed to be a cat breed. In fact, the tabby pattern is found in 
        many breeds, as well as among the general mixed-breed population. The 
        tabby pattern is a naturally occurring feature that may be related to 
        the coloration of the domestic cat's direct ancestor, the African
        wildcat, which (along with the European wildcat and Asiatic wildcat) has 
        a similar coloration.  -->
