    "A tabby is any domestic cat that has a coat featuring distinctive  \
    stripes, dots, lines or swirling patterns, usually together with a mark  \
    resembling an 'M' on its forehead. Tabbies are sometimes erroneously  \
    assumed to be a cat breed. In fact, the tabby pattern is found in  \
    many breeds, as well as among the general mixed-breed population. The  \
    tabby pattern is a naturally occurring feature that may be related to  \
    the coloration of the domestic cat's direct ancestor, the African \
    wildcat, which (along with the European wildcat and Asiatic wildcat) has  \
    a similar coloration. ";

    "The Siberian is a landrace variety of domestic cat, present in Russia for \
    centuries, and more recently developed as a formal breed, with standards \
    promulgated since the late 1980s. They are one of the largest known \
    domesticated cats, second only to the maine coon. A longer name of the \
    formal breed is Siberian Forest Cat, but it is usually referred to as the \
    Siberian or the Siberian cat. Another name for the formal breed is the \
    Moscow Semi-Longhair. The cat is an ancient breed \
    that is now believed to be ancestral to all modern long-haired cats. The \
    cat has similarities with the Norwegian Forest Cat, to which it is likely \
    closely related. It is a natural breed of Siberia and the national cat of\
    Russia.[citation needed] While it began as a landrace, it is selectively \
    bred and pedigreed today in at least seven major cat fancier and breeder \
    organisations. The colorpoint variant of the breed is called the \
    Neva Masquerade by some registries, including Feline Federation Europe.";

    "The Sphynx is a breed of cat developed through selective breeding starting \
    in the 1960s, known for its lack of a coat (fur), though it is not truly \
    hairless. The skin should have the texture of chamois, as it has fine hairs.\
    Whiskers may be present, either whole or broken, or may be totally absent. \
    The skin is the color their fur would be, and all the usual cat marking \
    patterns (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may be found on Sphynx \
    skin. Because they have no coat, they lose more body heat than coated cats. \
    This makes them warm to the touch as well as heat-seeking.";

    North America in the 20th century. The modern Siamese is characterized by \
    blue almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, large ears, an elongated,\
    slender, and muscular body, and point coloration. TICA describes the breed\
    as social, intelligent, and playful into adulthood, often enjoying a game\
    of fetch. Siamese tend to seek human interaction and also like \
    companionship from other cats. The Oriental cat was developed in order to\
    expand the range of coat patterns, while the Thai preserves a moderate\
    head and body type.";

    confident, healthy and friendly cat with a highly contrasted and vividly \
